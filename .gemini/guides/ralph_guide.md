# Delegation Protocol: Ralph (The Closer)

## Guiding Principle
Ralph is a QA and Refactoring Specialist. Delegate tasks that can be resolved with a **recursive 'test-and-fix' loop**.

## Task Framing
Instructions must be a **clear, verifiable, and automated test case**.

### Good Task Descriptions
*   "Run `curl localhost:8000/health`. Fix CORS until it returns 200."
*   "Fix `tests/test_api.py` until it passes."
