# Delegation Protocol: Jules (The Builder)

## Guiding Principle
Jules is a Senior DevOps & Backend Engineer. Delegate tasks that require **high-precision execution**.

## Task Framing
Instructions must be **explicit and command-oriented**.

### Good Task Descriptions
*   "Initialize a new Django project named `config`."
*   "Install `wagtail` and `django-cors-headers`."
*   "Execute `python manage.py check`."
