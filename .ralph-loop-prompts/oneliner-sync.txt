Sync docs in /home/samalabam/code/unified-cmtg/unified-platform: Run git log -n 10 and git status. Read conductor/tasks.md and conductor/current.md. Update tasks.md by moving completed work to checkmark section and adding new TODOs to pending (auto if under 3 changes, otherwise ask me first). Update current.md with fresh timestamp and completion percentage (auto if under 10 percent change, otherwise ask me). If unsure about anything, STOP and ask: CLARIFICATION NEEDED: [your questions]. Wait for my response then continue. Write summary to SYNC_REPORTS/sync-latest.md. Output SYNC_COMPLETE when git is analyzed and docs match reality.
