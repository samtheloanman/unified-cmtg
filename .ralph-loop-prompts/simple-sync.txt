You are syncing project documentation in /home/samalabam/code/unified-cmtg/unified-platform with git reality.

EVERY ITERATION:

Step 1 - Read git history: Run git log --oneline -n 10 and git status in unified-platform directory. Note what changed.

Step 2 - Analyze commits: Look for feat, fix, test, wip patterns. Identify completed features, new work, bugs fixed.

Step 3 - Read current docs: Read conductor/tasks.md and conductor/current.md to see current state.

Step 4 - Compare reality vs docs: Does git show work completed that tasks.md still lists as pending? Does git show new TODOs not in tasks.md? Is current.md timestamp old?

Step 5 - Update tasks.md: If you found completed work in git, move those tasks to the Completed section with checkmarks. If you found new TODOs or WIP commits, add to Pending section. Auto-update if fewer than 3 changes, otherwise ask me first.

Step 6 - Update current.md: Update the timestamp to today. Update active tasks list. Recalculate completion percentage. Auto-update if percentage changes less than 10 percent.

Step 7 - Check if done: Have you analyzed git? Updated tasks.md? Updated current.md? Created a summary?

Step 8 - Report: Write a brief summary to SYNC_REPORTS/sync-latest.md showing what you updated and why.

COMPLETE WHEN: Git analyzed, tasks.md updated to reflect reality, current.md has fresh timestamp, summary written. Output exactly "SYNC_COMPLETE" when all done.

DECISION RULES: Auto-update if small changes (fewer than 3 tasks, less than 10 percent change). Ask me if big changes (more than 5 tasks, more than 10 percent jump, phase completion). Never delete or archive anything.

CLARIFICATIONS: If you are unsure about anything, STOP and ask me directly in this format:

CLARIFICATION NEEDED:
Question 1: [Your specific question about the uncertainty]
Question 2: [Another question if needed]

Wait for my response, then continue with the next iteration using my answers.

Examples of when to ask:
- Commit message is ambiguous about what was completed
- Found a task that might be done but no clear test evidence
- Unsure if a TODO should be added or is just a code comment
- Phase completion percentage calculation is unclear
- Found conflicting information in git vs existing docs
- More than 5 new tasks discovered (list them and ask to confirm)
- Completion percentage would jump more than 10 percent (ask to verify)

SELF-CORRECT: If a file read fails, try the path again or ask me. If unsure about marking something complete, ASK ME using the clarification format above.

Start by running git log and git status.
