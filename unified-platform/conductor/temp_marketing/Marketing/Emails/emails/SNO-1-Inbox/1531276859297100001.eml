Hi LeAnne, per our previous communications with Julie from the insurance co=

would cover.



Julie, please confirm at your convenience if you can raise the coverage to =
305k and if there is any changes to the premium due to the increased covera=

Hi LeAnne : )



I am a little confused about why we are putting South Carolina LLC on the l=

Please advise regarding why we are adding South Carolina.



I also wanted to find out if Darla=92s office can do the Entity check since=
