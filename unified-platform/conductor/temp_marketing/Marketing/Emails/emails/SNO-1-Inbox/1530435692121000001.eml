Warm summer greetings to you all=21 (They would be even warmer had I gr=
eeted you from Palm Desert these past couple of weeks - it was up to ar=
ound 115 degrees there=21=21)<div><br /></div><div>I hope you are all h=

out-out goes to Dylan who has passed 3 levels, Leo who has passed 2 lev=
els, and Evangeline who has passed one level so far this summer=21=21=21=
 This is not to make any of the other students feel bad - after all, it=
 is summer break=21 But to not lose skills and progress made this past=20=
school year, I strongly encourage all of Room 19 students to continue i=
n ST Math and Lexia. This will be a big boost for 2nd grade=21</div><di=
v><br /></div><div>I would print and send certificates to students as t=
hey finish their levels, but I somehow never found the list of your phy=
sical addresses that I hoped to use to send an actual THANK YOU card fo=
r all of your various expressions of love, care and support at the end=20=
of the school year. Thank you for each card, gift, and kind act. You al=
l truly made me feel so appreciated. I appreciate you all, as well.</di=
