Gentlemen,
Are the both of you kidding me - MORE STATEMENTS? This is insane;
absolutely, INSANE! Give ME something in writing (other than these emails)
then, and only then, I MIGHT consider moving forward. I should have
listened my instincts and listed this house months ago.

Best Regards,
Michael D. Murray
