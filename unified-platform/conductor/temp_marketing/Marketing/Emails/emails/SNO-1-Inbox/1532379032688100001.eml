Hi Allie,

Hope you had a great weekend....My Brother and I are waiting patiently to
see what we are doing with the court/emergency filing and how legally to
move forward with the reunification. Randall Once again successfully stoped
the process. Where are the consequences for his lack of caring about any
court order or providing any documents regarding his health? where to go
from here. Could you please guide us on how we are moving forward as soon
as you can.

Thank You

Mahsa
