Hi Sam,
Thanks for the quick call today. As we discussed we can't make any side
deals outside the written terms of the agreement.
I'm looking forward to hearing back from you to confirm the proposed 10
days to remove contingencies on the Home Inspection and we can move forward
quickly.
Cheers,
Gail Vasquez
Douglas Elliman
