Hi Steven, I can get all the requested documents.  Are you able to give me =
tentative terms so I can them something tentative and request everything?

I can prepare our own fee sheet and fee agreement but wanted to get an idea=

Steven,

Not totally out of the question. We haven=92t yet financed anything above 2=
0 units, but we are entertaining some of these opportunities if the borrowe=
r and deal are buttoned up. See below for the items we would be looking for=
 on this one. It=92s a long list, but we need to do a lot of due diligence =
on these. The second list is basically an overview of the investment strate=
gy and asset that you can receive on one phone call.

I will give you a call to discuss.

See below for the items we will need to see to look at a MF deal:


=B7         Rent rolls (please include bed/bath count and unit size in sqft=
. for each unit)

=B7         Operating statement

=B7         Borrower=92s proforma numbers

=B7         Borrower=92s budget and construction timeline

=B7         Any pictures taken of the property

=B7         Any third parties already done for borrower (Past property cond=
ition assessment, seismic, environmental, valuation, etc.)

=B7         Condition of the big ticket items:

o   Roof

o   Electrical

o   Plumbing (galvanized steel or copper)

o   Mechanical

Questions to ask (you can get most of this on one call):

=B7         What is the investment strategy

=B7         What is the exit strategy? Please be as detailed as possible

=B7         How long of a note does the borrower need?

=B7         When does the borrower need to close?

=B7         Experience:

o   How many MF properties does the borrower own?

o   How many MF properties has the borrower owned for more than 12 months i=
n the last 5 years?

o   How many MF properties has the borrower =93flipped=94 in the last 3 yea=
rs?

=B7         Is the property stabilized?

=B7         If not, will the borrower increasing rents? Will the borrower b=
e rehabbing the units? How much rehab will be completed? Please provide con=
struction budget and overview of how long the rehab will take. Will they be=
 vacating units? Will they increase rents and then see if people leave? Ove=
rall, what is the process for increasing rents? Be as detailed as possible.

=B7         Are there any known existing environmental issues?

=B7         Is there tuck under parking?

=B7         Is there a laundry room? Pool? Elevator?

=B7         Are the utilities master metered? Separate meters?

=B7         How will the property be managed?

o   Will there be a management company?

o   If they will self-manage the property, do they have experience doing th=
is?

=B7         Are there section 8 tenants?

=B7         If yes, does the borrower have experience with Section 8 tenant=
s?

=B7         Is the property rent controlled?

Hey Whit =96 I just received this scenario below.  Borrower wants $3.4M on =
a refi loan on 60 unit complex in Dallas=85will use the money as stated bel=
ow.  Will we consider this?

Currently we are preparing to up-date, rehabilitation and restore the prope=
rty to ensure its profitability, and sustainability, while continuing to be=
 competitive with the most valued apartment complexes in our area.  At the =
completion of the rehab project, our property lease agreements will be in-l=
ine with other neighboring community apartment complexes. Our 48 single bed=
room units will have a fair market lease price of $1472.00, while our 12  t=
wo bedroom units will have a fair market lease price of $1782.00 per month.
