Well I have my marching orders for Jury Duty. I have to be there at 1:30 pm our time.  If I do not get chosen I think that will be it. You can email me and before 1pm  I will get them  and after 5 or 6pm after I get out.
As far as closing Jason can be there anytime.

Jason's number is 704-467-2819 but he may not be able to help, he does not know where to find things.
Have a great weekend!
Margaret
