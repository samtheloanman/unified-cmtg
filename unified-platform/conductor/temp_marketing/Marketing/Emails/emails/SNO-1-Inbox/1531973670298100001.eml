>=20
> Have you ever experienced a rankings decline and suspected it was due to s=
omething a competitor was doing?
>=20
> For this second article, we are going to focus on the process of diagnosin=
g whether or not you=E2=80=99ve been hit by negative search engine optimizat=
ion (SEO) techniques.
>=20
> If you need a refresher or missed the first article, here it is: What Nega=
tive SEO is and is Not.
>=20
> As you progress through the following steps to try and diagnose what happe=
ned, you=E2=80=99ll need to honestly ask yourself whether the decline you=E2=
=80=99re facing is more a result of your own actions or due to someone actin=
g against you.
>=20
> It=E2=80=99s an important distinction; your first inclination can be to as=
sume someone is out to hurt you, while it might actually be something as sim=
ple as accidentally no-indexing your index, disallowing critical paths in ro=
bots.txt or having a broken WordPress plug-in that suddenly duplicates all y=
our pages with strange query parameters and improper canonicalization.
>=20
> In the first article, I segmented the majority of search signals into thre=
e buckets: links, content and user signals. In order to properly analyze the=
se buckets, we=E2=80=99re going to need to be able to rely on a variety of t=
ools.
>=20
> What will you need?
>=20
> A browser with access to Google and Bing to find content.
> Access to your raw weblogs to review content and user signals.
> Google Analytics to review content and user signals.
> Google Search Console to review content, links and user signals.
> Bing Webmaster Tools to review content, links and user signals.
> A link analysis tool to look at internal and inbound link data.
> A crawling and technical tool to review content and user signals.
> A plagiarism tool to review content.
> Let=E2=80=99s step through the different tools and scenarios to determine i=
f you were hit by negative SEO or if it=E2=80=99s just a mistake.
>=20
> How are Google and Bing treating my site?
>=20
> One of the simplest and easiest first steps to take is to check how Google=
 and Bing are treating your site.
>=20
> I like to use both engines in every audit because they react differently, w=
hich helps me quickly diagnose a problem. What are we looking for?
>=20
> Site:domain.tld. Replace =E2=80=9Cdomain.tld=E2=80=9D with your actual dom=
ain. Both engines will return a list of pages from your domain, in a rough o=
rder of importance.
>=20
> Are pages missing that you would expect to see due to their value? Look at=
 the source code and robots.txt handling of those pages to determine whether=
 they are accidentally being blocked by a misconfiguration.
> Are pages being demoted? If the index page is suddenly not in the top spot=
, something is probably wrong. Running this simple check recently, we notice=
d our preferred URL handling was causing our index page=E2=80=99s canonical t=
o update to a page that 301 redirects back in a loop. Google had demoted thi=
s page on the site: query, but Bing didn=E2=80=99t. The problem was solved j=
ust by running that simple check and looking into the problematic page.
> Are there pages you don=E2=80=99t recognize? Do those pages look like some=
thing as simple as a misconfigured setting in your content management system=
 (CMS) that allows strange indexation, or are these pages off-theme and spam=
my? The former is likely a mistake; the latter is probably an attack.
> Perform some branded queries. Search for domain.ltd, domain and other popu=
lar or normal phrases associated with your brand. Are you suddenly not ranki=
ng for them as you previously were? If not, were you overtaken by any suspic=
ious results?
> Raw weblogs
>=20
> Having access to your raw weblogs is vital, but unfortunately, it is going=
 to be made significantly more difficult with broader adoption of General Da=
ta Protection Regulation (GDPR).
>=20
> It is vital that you can access internet protocols (IPs) recorded in each o=
f the pages visited on your site, including those you may not have the Googl=
e Analytics tracking code on. By parsing your logs, you can:
>=20
> Find IPs. This determines if the same group of IPs has been probing your s=
ite for a configuration weakness.
> Identify scrapers. Know if scrapers have been attempting to pull down cont=
ent en masse.
> Identify response issues. If you=E2=80=99re having a number of server resp=
onse issues where you wouldn=E2=80=99t expect to see them, you will now.
> Many issues can be solved if you have access and the inclination to parse y=
our logs for patterns. It=E2=80=99s time-consuming but worth doing.
>=20
> Google Analytics
>=20
> This could be its own series, as there are a multitude of areas to focus o=
n within any sophisticated analytics package. However, let=E2=80=99s focus o=
n some of the more obvious pieces:
>=20
> Bounce rate. Has it been trending up or down? How does this correspond wit=
h what you=E2=80=99re seeing in your raw logs. Is Google filtering out some o=
f the bouncing traffic? Is the bounce rate showing any outliers when segment=
ing by channel (source), by browser or by geographic location?
> Session duration. Similar to bounce rate, for user signal purposes, are th=
e sessions becoming abbreviated? Especially if also accompanied by an increa=
se in overall sessions?
> All traffic channels and all traffic referrals. Are any sources now sendin=
g significantly more or less traffic when compared to periods in which your r=
ankings were better? Are there unusual sources of traffic coming in that see=
m fake? Both are issues to research when you suspect negative SEO.
> Search console and landing pages. Similar to the Search Analytics check on=
 Google Search Console itself, are there aberrations in which pages are now g=
etting traffic, or are you seeing a large change in bounce and session durat=
ion on the pages you care about?
> Site speed. All things being equal, a faster site is a better site. Has th=
e load time been increasing? Is it specifically increasing on Chrome? For sp=
ecific pages? Are those pages that appeared benign ones that you didn=E2=80=99=
t previously recognize?
> Google Search Console
>=20
> What should you be looking for in Google Search Console (GSC) to help you d=
etermine if you=E2=80=99ve been a victim of negative SEO?
>=20
> Messages. If there is a massive change that Google wants to inform you abo=
ut, such as a manual action due to incoming or external links, crawl problem=
s or accessibility issues, messages in your GSC are the first place to look.=
 If Google thinks you=E2=80=99ve been hacked, it will let you know.
> Search analytics. Looking at your queries over time, you can sometimes spo=
t an issue. For instance, if query volumes associated with your branded and i=
mportant phrases spike, did you see an uptick in clicks to your pages? If no=
t, this could be an attempt to impact one user signal. Are your less importa=
nt pages being sourced on the queries you care about? This could instead poi=
nt to an issue with your content and content architecture.
> Links to your site. The obvious thing to look for is a large influx of low=
-quality, spammy links. But are they bad links?  If I cherry-pick some of th=
e worst links and see that they are blocking AhrefsBot, this tells me they a=
re probably spammy links which need to go.
> Internal links. What pages are you linking to heavily that you didn=E2=80=99=
t realize you were linking to? It could be a navigational issue, or it could=
 be a situation where you=E2=80=99re linking to a spammy doorway page inject=
ed into your CMS.
> Manual actions. It should also exist in messages, but if you have a manual=
 action, you need to address it immediately. It doesn=E2=80=99t matter what t=
he reasons are; even if there was a legitimate attack on your site, you must=
 fix it right away.
> Crawl errors. Rule out a ranking drop due to malicious intent by checking o=
n the stability of your setup. If your server is throwing too many 500 respo=
nses, Google will crawl it less. If this occurs, chances are users are going=
 to encounter more issues with your web pages, and it will slip in the ranki=
ngs as RankBrain folds in the user data. If you pair this with raw weblog da=
ta, you might see if the server instability is due to an attack.
> Bing Webmaster Tools
>=20
> How can you determine what=E2=80=99s going on with your Bing rankings? Hea=
d to their webmaster tools and check for the following:
>=20
> Site activity. Similar to Search Analytics data from Google, Bing Webmaste=
r Tools allow you to quickly assess whether your site is showing more or les=
s frequently in search as a whole, whether click volume has changed, if ther=
e=E2=80=99s been a change on crawling and crawl errors, and, of course, page=
s indexed. You can give each section a deeper look.
> Inbound links. Just as with Google Search Console, you can see how these l=
inks look. Are they unexpected at all? Can they be found in different link a=
nalysis tools?
> Link analysis tool
>=20
> Using  your favorite link analysis tool, look at these points to determine=
 if you=E2=80=99ve been hit with negative SEO:
>=20
> Organic keywords. Do you see a general trend in rankings? This should roug=
hly match with the search analytics data from Google, but not always. Chance=
s are you already know by this point that something is awry, but looking at t=
he same data through a different visualization can determine if there is a p=
roblem.
> New backlinks and new domains and referring IPs. If you=E2=80=99re experie=
ncing an attack, this is where you most likely will find it, if you see a la=
rge increase in links that you did not commission and do not want. Look at b=
oth of these reports, because having 2,000 pages on the same domain link to y=
ou is viewed differently from 2,000 new domains linking to you. In some case=
s, you may also find a large number of domains linking from the same IP. It=E2=
=80=99s a lazy negative SEO tactic, but it=E2=80=99s one of the more common o=
nes.
> Lost backlinks and lost domains. Another vector of negative SEO is getting=
 a competitor=E2=80=99s links removed. Are you losing links you previously w=
orked hard to secure? You might need to reach out to those webmasters to fin=
d out why. Are pages linking to you suddenly inaccessible and now linking to=
 a competitor? Or not linking to you at all?  You need to find out why.
> Broken backlinks. Sometimes a linking issue is your own. If you recently m=
oved a site, made an architecture change or even updated a plug-in, you migh=
t have inadvertently caused a page to go offline, which results in lost link=
 equity. Fixing this is as simple as bringing back the lost pages or redirec=
ting the pages to a relevant page to capture a large percentage of the initi=
al link equity.
> Anchors. Not enough time is focused here, even though over-optimization pe=
nalties and filters still exist. Did the change in links change your anchor t=
ext distribution, putting your commercial phrases in an unhealthy range? Are=
 the overall phrases still looking OK, but the singular terms appear to be m=
ore targeted than previously? Are you getting a lot of incoming phrases that=
 you would rather not be associated with?
> Outgoing linked domains and outgoing broken links. It is healthy to look t=
o see if you are now perceived to be linking to areas where you did not wish=
 to be linking and to check to ensure that those you wanted to be linking to=
 still resolve as valid URLs. Injections to a CMS, indexed comments and othe=
r user-generated content (UGC)-type areas should be looked at.
> Crawling and technical tools
>=20
> Similar to the section on link analysis, if you have a favorite crawling a=
nd technical SEO tool, use that in your approach to determine if you=E2=80=99=
ve been hit by negative SEO.
>=20
> Site speed. How does the crawl site speed compare to what is found in Goog=
le Analytics or on individually run Google site speed tests? Are you being h=
ampered by a large resource attempting to slow you down?
> Indexation status by depth. This is where manipulating your CMS setup and w=
eb architecture can really hurt if you=E2=80=99re suddenly duplicating or in=
dexing a large percentage of pages, to the detriment of pages you do want to=
 have indexed.
> Redirects. Namely, are you susceptible to open redirects which are leachin=
g off of your available link equity?
> Crawl mapping. Conceptually this can be very useful when attempting to det=
ermine if there are active pages you really don=E2=80=99t want and how inter=
nal link distribution may be affecting them. Are they all orphaned pages (i.=
e., they exist but are not internally linked to), or are they embedded into t=
he site=E2=80=99s navigation?
> On-page technical factors. This is the most important part, as it pertains=
 to determining whether the situation is a negative SEO attack or an interna=
l mistake. Crawling tools can help you quickly find which pages are set to n=
ofollow or noindex or are conflicted due to canonicalization problems.
> Plagiarism tool
>=20
> How unique is your content? There are other plagiarism checkers, but Copys=
cape is the most popular, and it is thorough.
>=20
> Check your entire site. The simplest way to check is to have a plagiarism s=
ervice crawl your site and then attempt to find significant string matches o=
n other web pages found in the Google and Bing index. If you=E2=80=99re the t=
arget of fake Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) requests or parasitic s=
crapers that are attempting to both copy you and outrank you on more authori=
tative domains, this will help you find such issues.
> Internal duplication. While most might assume that a competitor is attempt=
ing to scrape and replace them, the greater issue is internally duplicated c=
ontent across a blog, across categorical and tag setups, and improper URL ha=
ndling.
> Wrap-up
>=20
> Using a number of tools to determine if you=E2=80=99ve been hit by negativ=
e SEO is a good idea. They will help you find issues quickly and in detail. K=
nowing if you=E2=80=99ve been hit, and how, is crucial to help you respond a=
nd clean up the mess so you can move forward.

<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">It=E2=80=99s an i=
mportant distinction; your first inclination can be to assume someone is out=
 to hurt you, while it might actually be something as simple as accidentally=
 no-indexing your index, disallowing critical paths in robots.txt or having a=
 broken WordPress plug-in that suddenly duplicates all your pages with stran=
ge query parameters and improper canonicalization.</p>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">In the first arti=
cle, I segmented the majority of search signals into three buckets: links, c=
ontent and user signals. In order to properly analyze these buckets, we=E2=80=
=99re going to need to be able to rely on a variety of tools.</p>
<h2 style=3D"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.43em; max-width: 100%;">What wi=

<ul style=3D"max-width: 100%;">
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;">A browser with access to Google and Bing to f=

<h2 style=3D"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.43em; max-width: 100%;">How are=
 Google and Bing treating my site?</h2>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">One of the simple=
st and easiest first steps to take is to check how Google and Bing are treat=
ing your site.</p>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">I like to use bot=

<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Are pages m=
issing that you would expect to see due to their value?</strong> Look at the=
 source code and robots.txt handling of those pages to determine whether the=
y are accidentally being blocked by a misconfiguration.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Are pages b=
eing demoted?</strong> If the index page is suddenly not in the top spot, so=
mething is probably wrong. Running this simple check recently, we noticed ou=
r preferred URL handling was causing our index page=E2=80=99s canonical to u=
pdate to a page that 301 redirects back in a loop. Google had demoted this p=
age on the site: query, but Bing didn=E2=80=99t. The problem was solved just=
 by running that simple check and looking into the problematic page.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Are there p=
ages you don=E2=80=99t recognize?</strong> Do those pages look like somethin=
g as simple as a misconfigured setting in your content management system (CM=
S) that allows strange indexation, or are these pages off-theme and spammy? T=
he former is likely a mistake; the latter is probably an attack.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Perform so=
me branded queries.</strong>&nbsp;Search for domain.ltd, domain and other po=
pular or normal phrases associated with your brand. Are you suddenly not ran=
king for them as you previously were? If not, were you overtaken by any susp=
icious results?</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=3D"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.43em; max-width: 100%;">Raw web=
logs</h2>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">Having access to y=
our raw weblogs is vital, but unfortunately, it is going to be made signific=
antly more difficult with broader adoption of General Data Protection Regula=
tion (GDPR).</p>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">It is vital that y=
ou can access internet protocols (IPs) recorded in each of the pages visited=
 on your site, including those you may not have the Google Analytics trackin=
g code on. By parsing your logs, you can:</p>
<ul style=3D"max-width: 100%;">
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Find IPs. <=
/strong>This determines if the same group of IPs has been probing your site f=
or a configuration weakness.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Identify s=
crapers</strong>. Know if scrapers have been attempting to pull down content=
 en masse.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Identify r=
esponse issues.</strong> If you=E2=80=99re having a number of server respons=
e issues where you wouldn=E2=80=99t expect to see them, you will now.</li>
</ul>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">Many issues can b=
e solved if you have access and the inclination to parse your logs for patte=
rns. It=E2=80=99s time-consuming but worth doing.</p>
<h2 style=3D"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.43em; max-width: 100%;">Google A=
nalytics</h2>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">This could be its=
 own series, as there are a multitude of areas to focus on within any sophis=
ticated analytics package. However, let=E2=80=99s focus on some of the more o=
bvious pieces:</p>
<ul style=3D"max-width: 100%;">
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Bounce rat=
e.</strong> Has it been trending up or down? How does this correspond with w=
hat you=E2=80=99re seeing in your raw logs. Is Google filtering out some of t=
he bouncing traffic? Is the bounce rate showing any outliers when segmenting=
 by channel (source), by browser or by geographic location?</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Session du=
ration.</strong> Similar to bounce rate, for user signal purposes, are the s=
essions becoming abbreviated? Especially if also accompanied by an increase i=
n overall sessions?</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">All traffi=
c channels and all traffic referrals.</strong> Are any sources now sending s=
ignificantly more or less traffic when compared to periods in which your ran=
kings were better? Are there unusual sources of traffic coming in that seem f=
ake? Both are issues to research when you suspect negative SEO.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Search con=
sole and landing pages.</strong> Similar to the Search Analytics check on Go=
ogle Search Console itself, are there aberrations in which pages are now get=
ting traffic, or are you seeing a large change in bounce and session duratio=
n on the pages you care about?</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Site speed=
.</strong> All things being equal, a faster site is a better site. Has the l=
oad time been increasing? Is it specifically increasing on Chrome? For speci=
fic pages? Are those pages that appeared benign ones that you didn=E2=80=99t=
 previously recognize?</li>
</ul>

ole</h2>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">What should you b=
e looking for in Google Search Console (GSC) to help you determine if you=E2=
=80=99ve been a victim of negative SEO?</p>
<ul style=3D"max-width: 100%;">
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Messages.<=
/strong> If there is a massive change that Google wants to inform you about,=
 such as a manual action due to incoming or external links, crawl problems o=
r accessibility issues, messages in your GSC are the first place to look. If=
 Google thinks you=E2=80=99ve been hacked, it will let you know.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Search ana=
lytics.</strong> Looking at your queries over time, you can sometimes spot a=
n issue. For instance, if query volumes associated with your branded and imp=
ortant phrases spike, did you see an uptick in clicks to your pages? If not,=
 this could be an attempt to impact one user signal. Are your less important=
 pages being sourced on the queries you care about? This could instead point=
 to an issue with your content and content architecture.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Links to y=
our site.</strong> The obvious thing to look for is a large influx of low-qu=
ality, spammy links. But are they bad links?&nbsp; If I cherry-pick some of t=
he worst links and see that they are blocking AhrefsBot, this tells me they a=
re probably spammy links which need to go.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Internal l=
inks.</strong> What pages are you linking to heavily that you didn=E2=80=99t=
 realize you were linking to? It could be a navigational issue, or it could b=
e a situation where you=E2=80=99re linking to a spammy doorway page injected=
 into your CMS.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Manual</st=
rong> <strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">actions.</strong> It should also ex=
ist in messages, but if you have a manual action, you need to address it imm=
ediately. It doesn=E2=80=99t matter what the reasons are; even if there was a=
 legitimate attack on your site, you must fix it right away.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Crawl erro=
rs.</strong> Rule out a ranking drop due to malicious intent by checking on t=
he stability of your setup. If your server is throwing too many 500 response=
s, Google will&nbsp;crawl it less. If this occurs, chances are users are goi=
ng to encounter more issues with your web pages, and it will slip in the ran=
kings as RankBrain folds in the user data. If you pair this with raw weblog d=
ata, you might see if the server instability is due to an attack.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=3D"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.43em; max-width: 100%;">Bing We=
bmaster Tools</h2>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">How can you deter=
mine what=E2=80=99s going on with your Bing rankings? Head to their webmaste=
r tools and check for the following:</p>
<ul style=3D"max-width: 100%;">
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Site activ=
ity. </strong>Similar to Search Analytics data from Google, Bing Webmaster T=
ools allow you to quickly assess whether your site is showing more or less f=
requently in search as a whole, whether click volume has changed, if there=E2=
=80=99s been a change on crawling and crawl errors, and, of course, pages in=
dexed. You can give each section a deeper look.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Inbound li=
nks.</strong> Just as with Google Search Console, you can see how these link=
s look. Are they unexpected at all? Can they be found in different link anal=
ysis tools?</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=3D"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.43em; max-width: 100%;">Link an=
alysis tool</h2>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">Using&nbsp; your f=
avorite link analysis tool, look at these points to determine if you=E2=80=99=
ve been hit with negative SEO:</p>
<ul style=3D"max-width: 100%;">
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Organic ke=
ywords.</strong> Do you see a general trend in rankings? This should roughly=
 match with the search analytics data from Google, but not always. Chances a=
re you already know by this point that something is awry, but looking at the=
 same data through a different visualization can determine if there is a pro=
blem.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">New backli=
nks and new domains and referring IPs.</strong> If you=E2=80=99re experienci=
ng an attack, this is where you most likely will find it, if you see a large=
 increase in links that you did not commission and do not want. Look at both=
 of these reports, because having 2,000 pages on the same domain link to you=
 is viewed differently from 2,000 new domains linking to you. In some cases,=
 you may also find a large number of domains linking from the same IP. It=E2=
=80=99s a lazy negative SEO tactic, but it=E2=80=99s one of the more common o=
nes.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Lost backl=
inks and lost domains.</strong> Another vector of negative SEO is getting a c=
ompetitor=E2=80=99s links removed. Are you losing links you previously worke=
d hard to secure? You might need to reach out to those webmasters to find ou=
t why. Are pages linking to you suddenly inaccessible and now linking to a c=
ompetitor? Or not linking to you at all?&nbsp; You need to find out why.</li=
>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Broken bac=
klinks.</strong> Sometimes a linking issue is your own. If you recently move=
d a site, made an architecture change or even updated a plug-in, you might h=
ave inadvertently caused a page to go offline, which results in lost link eq=
uity. Fixing this is as simple as bringing back the lost pages or redirectin=
g the pages to a relevant page to capture a large percentage of the initial l=
ink equity.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Anchors.</=
strong> Not enough time is focused here, even though over-optimization penal=
ties and filters still exist. Did the change in links change your anchor tex=
t distribution, putting your commercial phrases in an unhealthy range? Are t=
he overall phrases still looking OK, but the singular terms appear to be mor=
e targeted than previously? Are you getting a lot of incoming phrases that y=
ou would rather not be associated with?</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Outgoing l=
inked domains and outgoing broken links.</strong> It is healthy to look to s=
ee if you are now perceived to be linking to areas where you did not wish to=
 be linking and to check to ensure that those you wanted to be linking to st=
ill resolve as valid URLs. Injections to a CMS, indexed comments and other u=
ser-generated content (UGC)-type areas should be looked at.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=3D"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.43em; max-width: 100%;">Crawlin=
g and technical tools</h2>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">Similar to the se=
ction on link analysis, if you have a favorite crawling and technical SEO to=
ol, use that in your approach to determine if you=E2=80=99ve been hit by neg=
ative SEO.</p>
<ul style=3D"max-width: 100%;">
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Site speed=
.</strong> How does the crawl site speed compare to what is found in Google A=
nalytics or on individually run Google site speed tests? Are you being hampe=
red by a large resource attempting to slow you down?</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Indexation=
 status by depth.</strong> This is where manipulating your CMS setup and web=
 architecture can really hurt if you=E2=80=99re suddenly duplicating or inde=
xing a large percentage of pages, to the detriment of pages you do want to h=
ave indexed.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Redirects<=
/strong>. Namely, are you susceptible to open redirects which are leaching o=
ff of your available link equity?</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Crawl mapp=
ing.</strong> Conceptually this can be very useful when attempting to determ=
ine if there are active pages you really don=E2=80=99t want and how internal=
 link distribution may be affecting them. Are they all orphaned pages (i.e.,=
 they exist but are not internally linked to), or are they embedded into the=
 site=E2=80=99s navigation?</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">On-page te=
chnical factors.</strong> This is the most important part, as it pertains to=
 determining whether the situation is a negative SEO attack or an internal m=
istake. Crawling tools can help you quickly find which pages are set to nofo=
llow or&nbsp;noindex or are conflicted due to canonicalization problems.</li=
>
</ul>
<h2 style=3D"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.43em; max-width: 100%;">Plagiar=
ism tool</h2>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">How unique is you=
r content? There are other plagiarism checkers, but Copyscape is the most po=
pular, and it is thorough.</p>
<ul style=3D"max-width: 100%;">
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Check your=
 entire site.</strong>&nbsp;The simplest way to check is to have a plagiaris=
m service crawl your site and then attempt to find significant string matche=
s on other web pages found in the Google and Bing index. If you=E2=80=99re t=
he target of fake Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) requests or parasi=
tic scrapers that are attempting to both copy you and outrank you on more au=
thoritative domains, this will help you find such issues.</li>
<li style=3D"max-width: 100%;"><strong style=3D"max-width: 100%;">Internal d=
uplication.</strong> While most might assume that a competitor is attempting=
 to scrape and replace them, the greater issue is internally duplicated cont=
ent across a blog, across categorical and tag setups, and improper URL handl=
ing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=3D"font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.43em; max-width: 100%;">Wrap-up=
</h2>
<p class=3D"clear" style=3D"max-width: 100%; clear: both;">Using a number of=
