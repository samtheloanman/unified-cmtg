Zelda, I'm glad you called because I know the purchase price won't be lower=
ed by the seller.=C2=A0 The price might be inflated or not depending on how=
 you appraise it, market vs. income but in this case the market approach wa=
s used and that's what the price will be so lowering it was never an option=
 for the seller who I've been speaking to mostly all along. They do want to=
 pursue the other option on the table involving a letter of credit but that=
 will play out in about a week as to whether it'll work or not. Do you have=
 any other options without having to lower the price? Respectfully, Mark Bu=
